# 🎯 Guess the Number - Rust Project

This is a simple **command-line guessing game** written in **Rust**. It's a beginner-friendly project where the program randomly picks a number, and the player has to guess it!

## 🛠️ Built With

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 🦀
- Standard Library only — no external dependencies

## 📌 How It Works

- The program randomly generates a number between 1 and 100.
- The user is prompted to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program tells you whether your guess was too low, too high, or correct.
- The loop continues until the correct guess is made.


## 🚀 Run it Locally

1. Make sure [Rust is installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aniket-ISTG/guess_the_number_in_rust.git
   cd guess_the_number_in_rust
